                  <h3>The Leading Non-Profit University in KSA!</h3>
                  <p>Prince Sultan University (PSU) is a institution of higher education, founded in 1999. The business community of Riyadh first developed the idea of founding the university. They dedicated PSU to HRH Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz to celebrate his homecoming after his successful medical treatment aboard. HRH Prince Sultan Abdul Aziz congratulated the community on this initiative, and he gave a generous donation to the Riyadh Philanthropic Society for Sciences to express his personal support for this important undertaking.

                  <p> 
                  One of the most popular ways to celebrate women in computing is by starting and/or attending an ACM-W Celebration of Women in Computing; the accomplishments of women in computing are at the heart of ACM-W's e-Newsletter and Blog. And ACM-W encourages its members to celebrate the work of prominent women by nominating them for Awards -- such as the Athena Award & Lecture -- as well as ACM Advanced Grade Membership.
